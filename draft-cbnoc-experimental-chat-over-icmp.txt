1.  Introduction

   Chat over ICMP protocol uses extra IP [@!RFC791] datagram bytes that
   are not used by ICMP [@!RFC792] to transport messages.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

3.1.  Format

   A structure of Chat over ICMP datagram is as follows :

   0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
   1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |
   Type | Code | Checksum |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |
   Topic ( first 4 bytes ) |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |
   Topic ( last 3 bytes ) | NUL (0x00) |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |
   Message ... +-+-+-+-+-

   IP Fields (derived from ICMP):

   Addresses

   The ip address of the source in a chat message will be the
   destination of the chat message.  If a sender wants to broadcast the
   message across the Topic space, the ip address of the destination
   should be a broadcast address.

   IP Fields (derived from ICMP):

   Type

   0 for a chat message.  In ICMP, this value means an echo reply
   message.

   Code

   0

   Checksum

   The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's complement
   sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP Type.  For computing
   the checksum , the checksum field should be zero.  If the total
   length is odd, the received data is padded with one octet of zeros
   for computing the checksum.  This checksum may be replaced in the
   future.

   Addresses

   The address of the source in an echo message will be the destination
   of the echo reply message.  To form an echo reply message, the source
   and destination addresses are simply reversed, the type code changed
   to 0, and the checksum recomputed.

   Topic

   The Identifier and Sequence Number fields defined by ICMP is
   repurposed to represent Topic of the chat.  Topic act as an
   identifier of a chat room so the receiver can categorize messages
   based on the value.

4.  Security Considerations

   Chat over ICMP protocol does not define any protection of message
   bytes.  Therefore, it MUST NOT be used to carry sensitive data which
   should be securely transported.  An implementation should consider
   that the data is not protected in any ways and it should give
   appropriate notice to its users about that risk.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
